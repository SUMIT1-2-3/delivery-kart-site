# Delivery Kart 🛒

This is a self-initiated e-commerce layout project built using HTML and CSS.  
It was my second website and a big leap in understanding how to structure a webpage properly — even before fully learning all the concepts.

## 💡 What I Did:
- Identified the key components of a delivery service site
- Used existing real websites as visual reference
- Prompted ChatGPT to guide me with structure and styling
- Implemented layout with sections like:
  - Header with logo and contact
  - Grid-based info sections
  - Footer with proper width/height planning

## 📌 What I Learned:
- Navbar structure with left and right alignment
- Applying footer styles
- Understanding how layout impacts UI
- Small intro to media queries
